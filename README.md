# DIY Photogate

This repository contains files related to Triple Helix DIY Photogate project based on the earlier "Science of the Slam" project at [RPI](http://rpi.edu/).
[Triple Helix](http://www.3helix.rpi.edu/) is an NSF-funded interdisciplinary science project that allows collaboration between graduate students and academics and local students and/or community members in addressing local issues related to health, environment, poverty, crime, information access, race, and more.

Special thanks go to the [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) project that was used to create the Python visualizations for this project.  Special thanks also go to the [WinPython](https://winpython.github.io/) project that was used to package this.
